## General

Soft tabs with two spaces should be always used, with nested elements indented only once. Code should typically be self documenting.

One of the most difficult aspects of programming is naming things, so take care when doing that.

There are always exceptions, so don't take this as gospel.

## HTML



## CSS

Below is a summary of the most important components, for a more in-depth guide, please see <http://codeguide.co/>.

### Selectors

Use hyphens in ID/Class selectors to separate words.

```css
.my-class {
  /* ... */
}

#my-id {
  /* ... */
}
```

### Values

Omit the units for 0 values.

```css
margin: 0;
padding: 0;
```

Don't include leading "0"'s in values between -1 and 1.

```css
opacity: .7;
```
